 This is built with `node.js` and `express.js` as a backend.

 As a frontend, `handlebars.js` is used.

 ## General Notes

This is a side project of mine, during my studies as a Software engineering and management student at the TU Graz. I did not want this project to take over my life, so I may have bodged it together in some places.

That being said: This does not impact the functionality or performance of `covidDash`, all it means, is that the code could be written a bit nicer. I will implement a Coding Standard at a later stage: when everything is finished and I can be bothered.

## Privacy

`CovidDash` **DOES NOT** store data of the users, let alone send it to me. 

## Data sources

- South African National Institute for Communicable diseases (NICD)
- Johns Hopkins University 

## Data Accuracy

```

       
It is possible that the Data shown may not be 100% accurate when viewing the Dashboard.

This is may happen shortly after new statistics have been published and the change has not yet propagated.

To fix this, have a look a bit later.
